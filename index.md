## Biography

### Dr Laia Pasquina Lemonche

I am a Research Associate in Professor Jamie Hobbsâ€™ group at University of Sheffield. I **graduated from Physics** at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) in **2015**Then, I received a **ster in Nanobiotechnology and Nanoscience** UAB. Then, I started her PhD in Biophysics at the University of Sheffield focused on deciphering the molecular architecture of gram-positive bacterial cell wall using AFM (L.Pasquina-Lemonche, J.Burns, et al, 2020, Nature). After my **PhD finished in August 2020**, I keep working in the Hobbs group focusing on understanding how the bacterial cell wall structure changes upon antibiotic treatments and other environments. Recently, I am developing new approaches to push the limits of resolution of biological material with AFM with the aim to study the peptidoglycan architecture of the cell wall more in detail.


## Research interests

My interests are the following: 

- Using the imaging power of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to interrogate biological samples
- Pushing the limits of resolution of current AFM methodologies to their limit
- Architecture and organisation of the bacterial cell wall (peptidoglycan) and other cell envelopes
- How does the architecture of the cell wall interacts with the function of the cell envelope for cell viability
- Using and developing image analysis softwares and pushing for open source coding and publication

Example of some of the imaging analysis that I am currently developing:
